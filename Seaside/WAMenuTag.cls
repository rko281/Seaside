WAMenuTag comment: 'no known browser supportThe menu element represents a list of commands.The type attribute indicates the kind of menu. It must have either the value popup (to declare a context menu) or the value toolbar (to define a tool bar). The attribute may also be omitted, to indicate that the element is merely a list of commands that is neither declaring a context menu nor defining a tool bar.If a menu element has a type attribute with the value popup, then it represents the commands of a context menu, and the user can only interact with the commands if that context menu is activated.If a menu element has a type attribute with the value toolbar, then it represents a list of active commands that the user can immediately interact with.Otherwise, if a menu element has no type attribute, or if has a type attribute with a value other than popup or toolbar, then it either represents an unordered list of items (each represented by an li element), each of which represents a command that the user may perform or activate, or, if the element has no li element children, a paragraph describing available commands.The label attribute gives the label of the menu. It is used by user agents to display nested menus in the UI. For example, a context menu containing another menu would use the nested menu''s label attribute for the submenu''s menu label.The autosubmit attribute is a boolean attribute that, if present, indicates that selections made to form controls in this menu are to result in the control''s form being immediately submitted.
