WAPainter comment: 'A Painter is an object that renders onto a Document using a Renderer (typically a subclass of WACanvas). The class of the Renderer is specified by #rendererClass.Subclasses should implement #renderContentOn: to do the actual rendering.Painters do not store or backtrack state and do not provide call/answer semantics or decorations. They are often created for each request, used, and then discarded. If you want any of the above features, you should use a subclass of WAPresenter or WAComponent.To cause a Painter to render itself, you should pass it to the #render: message of a Renderer. For example, from within a Component you could do the following:	renderContentOn: html		html render: MyPainterSubclass new'!
